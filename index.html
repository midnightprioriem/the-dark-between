                <em>The Dark Between</em> is a sort of "Steampunk", sort of
                "Gaslamp" fantasy setting that takes place on the planet of
                <b>Naos</b>. The heart of <em>The Dark Between</em> lies in
                the exploration of themes of gray morality authority versus
                autonomy, chaos and order, and the concept that the more we
                know about the Universe, the more we don't.
                <br><br>
                This setting has everything from unknowable elemental
                beings, powerful spellcasters, to genius inventors. <b>Naos</b>
                is a vast world, with many varying cultures and points of
                view—the technological wonders of <b>Aljieudum</b>, the
                stretching verdant hills of <b>Savaar</b>, and the
                militaristic might of <b>Tharsis</b>.

                    <h1 class="section">MAGIC IN NAOS</h2>
                </div>
                In Naos, the primary source of Magic is <b>The Luminary</b>,
                contained within a great celestial moon that orbits the
                planet. All living creatures on Naos are connected to the
                Luminary through an unseen, metaphysical strand known as a
                <b>Thread</b>, or <b>Tether</b>.

                <h2 class="section">Luminous Magic</h2>
                <img src="./assets/anh-le-magi-small.png" class="img-right" />
                <br>
                On Naos, Magic that is cast through The Luminary is called
                <b>Luminous Magic</b>. While <b>The Thread</b> gives all
                living creatures on Naos a connection to The Luminary, <em>creating</em>
                magic using The Thread is not so simple or easily done.
                Manifesting magical effects with Luminous Magic involves
                interfacing directly with the Luminary using the Thread and
                providing the celestial entity with a <b>Conviction</b>.

                <h3 class="section">Acronists</h3>
                Since wielding Luminous Magic is so difficult, it often (but
                not always) requires years of dedication and training to
                create anything meaningful with it. Those individuals that
                take the time to hone their Magic into something powerful
                are called <b>Acronists</b>.

                <h3 class="section">Convictions</h3>
                A <b>Conviction</b> is a statement of belief provided to The
                Luminary, something that is not true of the world but that
                the <b>Acronist</b> firmly believes in their mind and soul
                is true. When Luminous Magic is cast on Naos, the wielder
                must form a Conviction strong enough to convince The
                Luminary that whatever they want to happen <em>is reality</em>,
                thus manifesting their belief into the physical world. If a
                Conviction is strong enough, it can become a <b>Fixed Truth</b>.
                <h3 class="section">Fixed Truths</h3>
                A <b>Fixed Truth</b> is a <b>Conviction</b> created by
                Luminous Magic so powerful that rather than manifesting a
                temporary change to reality, the Conviction <em>becomes</em>
                a part of reality permanately. Even when the Acronist stops
                the Conviction, whatever the result reamins as the new truth
                of reality.

                    They are quite depressing, aren't they? I had a Great
                    Uncle that was a Fade. Strangest thing—there wasn't a
                    hint of color in his eyes. Other than that you would
                    never have known. He didn't do much, just sat around
                    skulking most of the time. Though perhaps he was just a
                    boring person, even before his thread was severed.

                Fades—or, <b>The Faded</b>—whether willingly or forcibly, have had
                their Thread to Magic was severed, rendering them unable to
                use Magic or be touched by it in any way.
                <br><br>
                In some cases, Fades tend to feel less emotion than other
                humans. Without conscious effort, they find themselves drawn
                towards quiet places and distance themselves from others. On
                the whole, however, Fades retain much of their original
                personality from before they where changed. Although their
                soul, their spiritual connection to the source of Magic has
                been severed, their human qualities remain.
                <br><br>
                Some Fades strive to overcome their lack of Magic by
                becoming experts in their field. Skilled blacksmiths,
                mathematicians, historians, warriors, engineers, and more.
                Their drive to make the most out of what they have and
                overcome their shortcomings gives them extraordinary
                determination.

                    to unmake your soul and bind it to such a odious being
                    is reprehensible. Worse, even than being untethered
                    entirely. To be shackled to the corrupt Soul is to
                    commit the highest of infedelities to the Luminary. It
                    is a mockery of the Faith.

                <b>Lightless</b> are humans who have chosen to forgo their
                tether to the Luminary and instead bind themselves to the
                corrupt Primal Spirit of Soul. They go by many other
                names—Karaatmar, Darklings, Demons.

                <br><br>
                Long ago, the Primal Spirit of Soul became twisted and
                defiled, and malformed into a new being. This new Corrupt
                Soul, still tethered to The Luminary, grew into a new symbol
                within the <b>Argentia</b>, an emblem of wickedness and all
                that is unholy within humanity. To many, the Lightless are a living blasphemy against the
                Luminary. Unlike the The Faded, who are simply untethered
                completely—and generally not by choice—the Lightless are
                untethered from the Luminary and bound to the corrupt soul
                instead. This pact gives the Lightless inhuman
                abilities—heightened senses, the ability to read emotions, a
                longer lifespan, and access to Magics that would otherwise
                be unreachable to mere humans.

                    <h2 class="section">The Primal Spirits</h2>
                </div>
                <b>The Primal Spirits</b> are comprised of six powerful
                beings, created
                from the The Luminary. The six primal spirits are Air,
                Water,
                Earth, Fire, Bone, and Soul.

                <h3 class="section">Origins</h3>
                In the beginnings of the world, when humans huddled around
                fires
                and struggled to survive, they often looked to beings beyond
                dieties with power outside of normal comprehension, either
                to
                worship or fear or to simply explain how the world around
                them
                worked.
                <br><br>
                In a sense, early humans saw these divine concepts as
                Universal
                Movers, beings that encompassed various aspects of their
                lives.
                In their belief and worship, humanity as a whole catalyzed a
                collective Conviction so strong that it these beings were
                willed
                into existence. Overtime, primordial beings were formed from
                the
                faith that existed within humanity. The Convictions that
                created
                these beings was so strong that it became a Fixed Truth in
                reality, allowing the spirits to continue to exist even as
                humanity evolved.

                <h3 class="section">Sentience</h3>
                It is unknown to the denizens of Naos whether the Primal
                Spirits
                are sentient, or simply forces of nature. In truth, the
                answer
                is more complex than that. The Primal Spirits themselves are
                far
                more complex constructs, both incomprehensible forces and,
                for
                lack of a better term, minds. They work as parts of a whole,
                and
                there are many instances of physical manifestations of the
                Primal Spirits coming into existence in the physical world,
                either pulled by a mortal that lives in it, or simply
                bubbled
                into existence by random chance. These manifestations can
                take
                many forms, both benign and dangerous. Many have been
                worshiped
                and feared as minor gods or monsters in their own right.
                <br><br>
                In some ways, the Primal Spirits have a “will” of their own,
                trying to shape the world in their image however they see
                fit.
                But they are also vastly incomprehensible, and often their
                influence on the world is met with fear and awe.

                <h3 class="section">Intrinsic Values</h3>
                Since the Primal Spirits were created by and for Humans,
                each of
                the spirits is also intrisically tied to certain values.
                These
                values influence how the Primal Spirits manifest in the
                world
                and their influence on it.
                <br><br>
                The Primal Earth is tied to the values of <em class="earth">Balance</em>,
                <em class="earth">Strength</em>, and <em class="earth">Neutrality</em>.
                <br><br>
                The Primal Air is tied to the values of <em class="air">Freedom</em>,
                <em class="air">Self</em>, and
                <em class="air">Honesty</em>.
                <br><br>
                The Primal Water is tied to the values of <em class="water">Change</em>,
                <em class="water">Adaption</em>,
                and <em class="water">Fear</em>.
                <br><br>
                The Primal Fire is tied to the values of <em class="fire">Passion</em>,
                <em class="fire">Life</em>, and
                <em class="fire">Fury</em>.
                <br><br>
                The Primal Bone is tied to the values of <em class="bone">Substance</em>,
                <em class="bone">Pain</em>,
                and
                <em class="bone">Death</em>.
                <br><br>
                The Primal Soul, prior to corruption, was tied to the values
                of
                <em class="soul">Thought</em>, <em class="soul">Morality</em>,
                and <em class="soul">Virtue</em>.
                <br><br>
                In the present, the Primal
                Soul
                is tied to the values of <em class="soul">Corruption</em>,
                <em class="soul">Manipulation</em>, and <em class="soul">Ego</em>.

                <h3 class="section">Facsimilies of Reality</h3>
                It is important to note that while the Spirits embody
                aspects of humanity, they are not true embodiments of what
                they represent. When they were created, that may of been
                true, but the Spirits, as semi-conscious immortal beings,
                have the potential to grow and shift over time of their own
                accord, and how the world indirectly influences them. The
                Elemental Spirits are most resistant to change—Rivers will
                always change the land, and the ocean will always strike
                fear into those who witness its vastness, but Bone and Soul
                are more subject to interpretation and change. Soul
                especially.

                <h3 class="section">Corruption of the Primal
                    Soul</h3>
                Of the spirits, Soul was always the most <em>concious</em>
                and aware. While the other Spirits were more animalistic in
                nature, Soul often manifests with more sentience. Over time,
                however, as humanity and civilization became more complex,
                and the understanding of what it means to be good or evil
                did as well, the Primal Soul becamed twisted, warping into a
                representation of the darkest corners of the human soul.
                While the Primal Soul is merely a reflection, in a way, and
                cannot be truly evil, this shift led many in the world of
                Naos to fear the Primal Soul, and treat it as such. For The
                Argent, The Primal Soul is seen as the personification of
                Evil, the wickedness of the heart should The Luminary not be
                followed.

                <h3 class="section">In the Modern Age</h3>
                In the modern age of Naos, most civilizations treat the
                Spirits as they are, powerful and primal beings that are
                vast and potentially dangerous, but not gods. Some
                civilations, however, still worship one or more of the
                spirits as dieites. Some Shifters worship the Primal Spirit
                of Bone as a sort of god-like figure. Pockets of Msanti
                culture worship Primal Water. There are various human
                cultures that worship the different elemental spirits in
                more ways than one.

                <h3 class="section">Creation of New Spirits</h3>
                While it is technically feasible for new spirits to be
                created, the largely varying cultures and beliefs that make
                up Naos in the modern age make in very unlikely that new
                spirits would come about. The rise of logic, reason, and
                science too make such a mass Conviction possible, at least
                without a deliberate and coordinated effort. The Primal
                Spirits were a certainly a unique occurance, and their
                creation the result of a perfect storm.

                <h3 class="section">Scions</h3>
                While extremely rare, it is possible for human-spirit
                hybrids to be born into the world, known as <b>Elemental
                    Scions</b>, or, in even rarer cases, <b>Shifters</b>.
                Scions are always born from a normal human parentage, and
                appear mostly human with some unique characteristics. Scions
                are simply born with an innate connection link to one of the
                Spirits, and are generally granted abilities based on their
                Spirit. The only Spirit that does not produce Scions is the
                Primal Soul.
