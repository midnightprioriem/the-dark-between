            <div class='content-block'>
                <em>The Dark Between</em> is a sort of "Steampunk", sort of "Gaslamp" fantasy setting that takes place on the planet of <b>Naos</b>. The heart of <em>The Dark Between</em> lies in the exploration of themes of gray morality authority versus autonomy, chaos and order, and the concept that the more we know about the Universe, the more we don't.
                <br><br>
                This setting has everything from unknowable elemental beings, powerful spellcasters, to genius inventors. <b>Naos</b> is a vast world, with many varying cultures and points of view—the technological wonders of <b>Aljieudum</b>, the stretching verdant hills of <b>Savaar</b>, and the militaristic might of <b>Tharsis</b>.
            </div>

            <div id="magic" class='content-block'>
                <div class="icon-inline-container">
                    <i class="ra ra-kaleidoscope header-two-icon" style="color:var(--purple)"></i>
                    <h1 id="magic-in-naos">MAGIC IN NAOS</h2>
                </div>
                In Naos, the primary source of Magic is <b>The Luminary</b>, contained within a great celestial moon that orbits the planet. All living creatures on Naos are connected to the Luminary through an unseen, metaphysical strand known as a <b>Thread</b>, or <b>Tether</b>.

                <h2 id="luminous-magic">LUMINOUS MAGIC</h2>
                <img src="./assets/anh-le-magi-small.png" class="img-right" />
                <br>
                On Naos, Magic that is cast through The Luminary is called <b>Luminous Magic</b>. While <b>The Thread</b> gives all living creatures on Naos a connection to The Luminary, <em>creating</em> magic using The Thread is not so simple or easily done. Manifesting magical effects with Luminous Magic involves interfacing directly with the Luminary using the Thread and providing the celestial entity with a <b>Conviction</b>.

                <h3 id="acronists">ACRONISTS</h3>
                Since wielding Luminous Magic is so difficult, it often (but not always) requires years of dedication and training to create anything meaningful with it. Those individuals that take the time to hone their Magic into something powerful are called <b>Acronists</b>.

                <h3 id="convictions">CONVICTIONS</h3>
                A <b>Conviction</b> is a statement of belief provided to The Luminary, something that is not true of the world but that the <b>Acronist</b> firmly believes in their mind and soul is true. When Luminous Magic is cast on Naos, the wielder must form a Conviction strong enough to convince The Luminary that whatever they want to happen <em>is reality</em>, thus manifesting their belief into the physical world. If a Conviction is strong enough, it can become a <b>Fixed Truth</b>.

                <h3 id="fixed-truths">FIXED TRUTHS</h3>
                A <b>Fixed Truth</b> is a <b>Conviction</b> created by Luminous Magic so powerful that rather than manifesting a temporary change to reality, the Conviction <em>becomes</em> a part of reality permanately. Even when the Acronist stops the Conviction, whatever the result reamins as the new truth of reality.

                <h2 id="the-faded">THE FADED</h2>
                <div class="first-line-caps" style="padding-left: 20px; font-style: italic;">
                    They are quite depressing, aren't they? I had a Great Uncle that was a Fade. Strangest thing—there wasn't a hint of color in his eyes. Other than that you would never have known. He didn't do much, just sat around skulking most of the time. Though perhaps he was just a boring person, even before his thread was severed.
                </div>
                <br>
                <div style="text-align: right">—Mekhag Ardashessian, <em>Memoirs of the Luminancer</em></div>

                </p>

                Fade—or, <b>The Faded</b>—whether willingly or forcibly, their Thread to Magic was severed, rendering them unable to use Magic or be touched by it in any way.
                <br><br>
                In some cases, Fades tend to feel less emotion than other humans. Without conscious effort, they find themselves drawn towards quiet places and distance themselves from others. On the whole, however, Fades retain much of their original personality from before they where changed. Although their soul, their spiritual connection to the source of Magic has been severed, their human qualities remain.
                <br><br>
                Some Fades strive to overcome their lack of Magic by becoming experts in their field. Skilled blacksmiths, mathematicians, historians, warriors, engineers, and more. Their drive to make the most out of what they have and overcome their shortcomings gives them extraordinary determination.

                <h2 id="the-lightless">THE LIGHTLESS</h2>
                <div class="first-line-caps" style="padding-left: 20px; font-style: italic;">
                    Foul, despicable creatures. To commit such a willing sin to unmake your soul and bind it to such a odious being is reprehensible. Worse, even than being untethered entirely. To be shackled to the corrupt Soul is to commit the highest of infedelities to the Luminary. It is a mockery of the Faith.
                </div>
                <br>
                <div style="text-align: right">—Kanada Badakar, <em>Exalted Vencus of the Argent</em></div>

                <b>Lightless</b> are humans who have chosen to forgo their tether to the Luminary and instead bind themselves to the corrupt Primal Spirit of Soul. They go by many other names—Karaatmar, Darklings, Demons.
                <br><br>
                Long ago, the Primal Spirit of Soul became twisted and defiled, and malformed into a new being. This new Corrupt Soul, still tethered to  The Luminary, grew into a new symbol within the <b>Argentia</b>, an emblem of wickedness and all that is unholy within humanity.
                <br><br>
                To many, the Lightless are a living blasphemy against the Luminary. Unlike the The Faded, who are simply untethered completely—and generally not by choice—the Lightless are untethered from the Luminary and bound to the corrupt soul instead. This pact gives the Lightless inhuman abilities—heightened senses, the ability to read emotions, a longer lifespan, and access to Magics that would otherwise be unreachable to mere humans.
