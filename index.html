            <em>The Dark Between</em> is a sort of "Steampunk", sort of "Gaslamp" fantasy setting that takes place on
            the planet of <b>Naos</b>. The heart of <em>The Dark Between</em> lies in the exploration of themes of gray
            morality, authority versus autonomy, chaos and order, and the concept that the more we know about the
            Universe, the more we don't.
            <br><br>
            This setting has everything from unknowable elemental beings, powerful spellcasters, to genius inventors.
            <b>Naos</b> is a vast world, with many varying cultures and points of view—the technological wonders of
            <b>Aljieudum</b>, the stretching verdant hills of <b>Savaar</b>, and the militaristic might of
            <b>Tharsis</b>.
        </div>

        <div id="magic" class='content-block'>
            <div class="icon-inline-container">
                <i class="ra ra-kaleidoscope header-two-icon" style="color:var(--purple)"></i>
                <h2>MAGIC IN NAOS</h2>
            </div>
            In Naos, the primary source of Magic is <b>The Luminary</b>, contained within a great celestial moon that
            orbits the planet. All living creatures on Naos are connected to the Luminary through an unseen,
            metaphysical strand known as a <b>Thread</b>, or <b>Tether</b>.

            <h3>LUMINOUS MAGIC</h3>
            <img src="./assets/anh-le-magi-small.png"
                style="max-width: 400px; width: 100%; padding: 20px; float: right" />
            <div class="img-shim"></div>
            <br>
            On Naos, Magic that is cast through The Luminary is called <b>Luminous Magic</b>. While <b>The Thread</b>
            gives all living creatures on Naos a connection to The Luminary, <em>creating</em> magic using The Thread is
            not so simple or easily done. Manifesting magical effects with Luminous Magic involves interfacing directly
            with the Luminary using the Thread and providing the celestial entity with a <b>Conviction</b>.

            <h3>ACRONISTS</h3>
            Since wielding Luminous Magic is so difficult, it often (but not always) requires years of dedication and
            training to create anything meaningful with it. Those individuals that take the time to hone their Magic
            into something powerful are called <b>Acronists</b>.

            <h3>CONVICTIONS</h3>
            A <b>Conviction</b> is a statement of belief provided to The Luminary, something that is not true of the
            world but that the <b>Acronist</b> firmly believes in their mind and soul is true. When Luminous Magic is
            cast on Naos, the wielder must form a Conviction strong enough to convince The Luminary that whatever they
            want to happen <em>is reality</em>, thus manifesting their belief into the physical world. If a Conviction
            is strong enough, it can become a <b>Fixed Truth</b>.

            <h3>FIXED TRUTHS</h3>
            A <b>Fixed Truth</b> is a <b>Conviction</b> created by Luminous Magic so powerful that rather than
            manifesting a temporary chagne to reality, the Conviction <em>becomes</em> a part of reality permanately.
            Even when the Acronist stops the Conviction, whatever the result reamins as the new truth of reality.

            <h3>THE FADED</h3>
            <div class="first-line-caps" style="padding-left: 20px; font-style: italic;">
                They are quite depressing, aren't they? I had a Great Uncle that was a Fade. Strangest thing—there
                wasn't a hint of color in his eyes. Other than that you would never have known. He didn't do much, just
                sat around skulking most of the time. Though perhaps he was just a boring person, even before his thread
                was severed.

            </p>
            It is possible, though rare, for an individual's Thread to be <em>severed</em>, cutting them off from The
            Luminary and the source of Magic.
