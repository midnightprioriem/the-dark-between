# The Exchange
In order for an Acronist to leverage a Primal Spirit in their Convictions, they must complete an Exchange. An Exchange can take many different forms, depending on both the particular Spirit involved and the specific cultural practices of the Acronist. In some cultures, such as the in Kingdom of Lashana, their worship of the Primal Fire gave their most devout worshippers control over the Aspects of Fire.

Typically, exchanges made with any of the Spirits are more simple, either involving a Summoning and capture of part of the Primal Spirit, or consistent worship of a particular Spirit. In rare cases, a Primal Spirit may reach into the physical realm and _choose_ a Scion, creating a pact with a mortal at birth, as is the case with Elemental Scions and Shifters.  
  
The exception, however, is the Primal Soul. The Primal Soul, considered more sentient and _aware_ than the other Spirits, often requires a **bargain** to be struck with the Acronist. Since the Corruption of the Primal Soul, exchanges with the Primal Soul are mostly frowned upon, and in some places, illegal.
