While they rarely leave their solitary existence, the more adventurous Deep Dwellers don pressurized suits that allow them to ascend to the surface and explore the overworld. These suits are made to be self-sustaining, keeping the Deep Dwellers that use them in water and under enough pressure to retain their form that would otherwise collapse while on the surface.

They have harnessed the geothermal power available to them to acheive technological prowess, creating mechanical feats that can operate even at the bottom of the ocean.

Land dwellers often travel to Msanti trading bazaars found in shallower water in order to trade.`}</p>\n    <p>{`The Deep Dwellers themselves represent a wide array of life. Some are nearly humanoid, the only differences being larger eyes to take in more light, and a lack of pigment to their skin. Others, however, can be more otherwordly, featuring an array of tentacles, teeth, bioluminescent fins, exoskeletons, and more.
